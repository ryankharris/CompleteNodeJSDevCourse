# web-server
This part of the course begins to introduce express as a web-server.
It introduces serving static assets.
It suggests using handlebars as a templating engine.
I am using Pug instead because I have wanted to try it out.

## Resources

* https://www.npmjs.com/package//nodemon


## Usage

To run the server:

    node ./src/app.js

To run and watch using Nodemon:

    nodemon ./src/app.js
